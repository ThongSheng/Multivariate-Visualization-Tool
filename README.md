# Multivariate-Visualization-Tool
An R shiny app that is developed to help users visualize their custom multivariate dataset.

This shiny app is partitioned into three different tabs. <br>
- First tab (Summary)
  - renders an image that summarizes what purposes each multivariate plotting technique serves (e.g. relationship, pattern recognition, comparison etc.).
- Second tab (Data file)
  - allows users to upload the dataset of their interest and renders the data file as output.
- Third tab (Visualization)
  - users select the types of plot they wish to see and the system renders the plot using the dataset that was uploaded in the second tab.
